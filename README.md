# Contact Book

## Introduction
Contact Book is a simple web application built using Flask and HTML/CSS that allows users to store and manage their contacts. Users can add new contacts, delete existing ones, and edit contact information as needed. The application also includes a simple search function to help users find specific contacts quickly.
